        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          For my website I was heavily inspired by the Sputnick Agency website and its cool collage aesthetic.
          <br> <br><a href="https://sputnikdesignteam.com/">Sputnik Design Team Website</a>
          <br><br>
          I also liked the look of the Youtube rewind website and how they used horizontal scroll. I thought it created
          a unique user experience that we don’t see very often. <br><br>
          <a href="https://rewind.youtube/">Youtube Rewind Website</a><br><br>
          I wanted to recreate this in my own way but incorporate my love for story telling. The goal was to have my
          index be an overall representation of who I am and my style. To execute this I decided to make it look like
          items from my purse have spilled out. I like the idea of different items symbolizing different aspects from
          class. Plus, some items are a story in itself. I’ve also seen scanner art on social media and liked the
          overall chaotic, yet intentional look. The vision for my index was to be a conglomeration of various items
          around my house that would represent different projects yet encapsulate my experimentave style. The scanned
          images would add a handmade aspect to the work and create a cohesive and dynamic look. <br><br> <a

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Scanning</h3>
        <p>
          I organized a list of all the things I needed to include on my index and started collecting items around the
          house. At first, I scanned various items that represent just myself to get an idea of how the overall website
          would look. Then I scanned a bunch of them and there was a lot of trial of error with lighting and positioning
          until I was content.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/jpg-scans.png" alt="Digital Folder of scanned images" width="100%">
          <figcaption>These are various items of items from around my house that I scanned</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Figma</h3>
        <p>
          Then I edited the images to be transparent background png files and uploaded them to Figma. I recreated the
          relative sizing for the page and how I would want them to recreate a scattered look.
          <br><br>
          For page oranization, I combined my readings to make it a more seamless experience for the user. I also
          decided
          to include an about page so viewers can get a sense of who I am as a designer. The links page is also a basic
          page with links categorized for different uses. To sort the process pages, I put the links all in one page so
          the user can choose which process they want to view first. I also did this so I could represent all 4 project
          process with one image. These pages all utilize the Sometype Mono Typeface because I wanted the miscellaneous
          pages to have an analog design like they were written on a typewriter. I thought it would make it recognizable
          that they are a grouping of other pages but also add a personal touch like a letter.
          <br><br>
          I also thought about how I wanted to incorporate animation and custom fonts. I saw one of my classmates
          interaction project and really liked the custom cursor they had. I recreated it in Figma to get a visual
          sense.
          The typeface of the cursor is the Google’s NovaSquare font. I liked the rounded edges and angles of the sans
          serif typeface that gave it a futuristic tech feel.

        <!-- End of image with caption -->
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>
          I started by grouping all my pngs into a class so they can be together. I also gave the imgs id attributes to
          make the styling more specific. In CSS, I had to give specific measurements since the original files are like
          3000px. I also changed the x and y overflow so that it was just a horizontal scroll. The background image is a
          scan of the scanner with nothing on it to recreate the texture. As I was placing the images, I originally
          intended to have them be positioned randomly every page refresh but opted against this because I like having
          the order of assignment groupings be consistent. This would make it easier for the user to navigate if they
          catch on to the pattern.
          <br><br>
          For the cursor I followed a Youtube video that taught me how to animate a cursor to have spinning circular
          text. To split the words into separate characters I used a splitting cdn link. To create the animation I used
          a link from the GSAP animation library. I adjusted some of the script to troubleshoot and change the rate at
          which it moves with the cursor.

      <h2>The Icon's Meanings</h2>
      <h3>About: Red Journal</h3>
      <p>
        This is my personal scrap journal and it’s filled with a bunch of items like tickets, wristbands, stickers,
        fortune cookie slips, and more. I like that the cover is vibrant and playful like my own artistic style. It also
        has a Mom’s Spaghetti sticker on it as an homage to my home in Detroit, Michigan. This journal is a visual
        collective of who I am.
      </p>
      <h3>Readings: 1984 Book</h3>
      <p>
        I chose the book 1984 from my collection because it felt relevant with the loose theme of technology and how it
        can be used. Although, this book is more about surveillance and political oppression, it’s ideology around data
        reminded me a little bit of Data as a Symbolic Form. The juxtaposition of the IMW reading and 1984 shows that
        data plays such a crucial role in our lives and can be used to either have a personable user experience or a
        form of patrolling.
      </p>
      <h3>Links: Chain Necklace</h3>
      <p>
        The chain necklace was a fun visual representation of the links that I used throughout my time in class. I liked
        the idea of breaking up the square shaped images with something more fluid like a necklace.
      </p>
      <h3>Storybook: AGO Map</h3>
      <p>
        The storybook is represented by an AGO map I had in my scrap journal. I chose it because it encompasses the
        story of the art museum coming to life.
      </p>
      <h3>Poster: Tarot Card</h3>
      <p>In the world of tarot, the Justice card symbolizes equity and the truth and law. I thought this would be
        perfect for my poster design of the Black Panthers film festival screening.</p>
      <h3>Interaction: Newspaper</h3>
      <p>My doom scroll project evolved around the idea of sourcing negative headlines from a world news API. This
        newspaper was perfect to encapsulate the constant negative headlines that give us anxiety.</p>
      <h3>Grid Exercise: Frame</h3>
      <p>The frame is a scanned image of a mini artwork magnet I had on my fridge. I thought it would be quite fitting
        for the recreation of famous paintings.</p>
      <h3>Fonts and Animations Exercise: Cut Out Letters</h3>
      <p>These are also magnets from my fridge. I liked these because it’s a playful way of displaying a project about
        typography. I also enjoy the collage look to it.</p>
      <h3>Flexbox Exercise: Magazine</h3>
      <p>The Flexbox exercise reminded me of a newspaper or magazine column. I found this page in a magazine and thought
        it worked well since the foundation of the design is heavily based on columns.</p>
      <h3>JavaScript Exercise: Markers</h3>
      <p>I chose these markers because they matched the colors interaction portion of the exercise. It also made me
        think as if the interaction results in coloring in the background with the corresponding color. </p>
      <h3>JQuery Exercise: A deck of cards</h3>
      <p>The deck of cards symbolizes jQuery as if each card represents a different function. Similar to various
        combinations, the cards work together to create a playable hand. Each card (or jQuery function) plays a unique
        role, contributing to the overall success of the project.
      </p>
      <h3>Responsiveness Excercise: Mobile Phone</h3>
      <p>To represent my responsive website from desktop to mobile, I scanned my phone and photoshopped the meme that I
        used. It’s a literal visual of what the website would look like on a mobile screen.</p>
      <h3>JSON Exercise: Money</h3>
      <p>For this assignment I use an api to create a currency converter. To best represent this I utilized a crumpled
        dollar bill.</p>
      <h3>Favicon Exercise: Flowers</h3>
      <p>The flowers are to resemble the favicon on my index. The flower favicon is a personal logo of mine to brand my
        name.</p>
      <h3>Process Work: Journal notes</h3>
      <p>To show the process work I scanned a storyboard for the first project. I like how the texture from the real
        journal showed up on the website.</p>
