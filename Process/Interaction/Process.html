        <h2>Concept Ideation</h2>
        <p>
          Originally I had looked into parallax scrolling, and wanted to evolve my idea around storytelling. However,
          when consulting with Prof. Ha I realized that my idea was too centered around the content of my website rather
          than the interaction element by itself. By suggestion, I looked more into the history of scrolling, infinite
          scroll, and the scroll bar. I was also inspired to use a play of the word scroll or to even take inspiration
          from everyday life. So I came upon the concept I have known as doom scrolling. By definition, it is the act of
          consuming negative media on the internet that can have a huge impact on your mental health. Prof. Ha also
          recommended that I source live news using JSON and API that we learned that day to enhance my idea even
          farther.
          <br>
          <br>
          Overall, I wanted to encapsulate the idea of doom scrolling in my website by having a page that is populated
          with bad news the further you scroll to embody the user experience of literally entering the void of the doom
          scroll abyss.

        <h2>Visual Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          For aesthetics I really liked the overcrowded look of the blank windows website that was recommended as a
          resource for the project. I eventually used this look in my design by recreating the white boxes and a shadow
          to add depth to the look.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also created an are.na account to gain inspiration for the different ways people have utilized the scroll
          bar, but deviated my idea from these websites.
          <br>
          <br>
          I also found inspiration from the research that I did based on the impact of the infinite scroll. Infinite
          scroll affects your mental health, attention span, and can even contribute to polarization and extremism. By
          incorporating the infinite scroll, I wanted it to be a symbol of never ending escape from bad news once you go
          down the rabbit hole. I want the user to feel overwhelmed with the nasty headlines the further they scroll. I
          also wanted the news to get worse the deeper the user goes.

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        I originally wanted the visuals to be screengrabs of the articles themselves but realized that would be a lot
        harder when using just data from world news apis. So, I went with the simple white boxes and Times New Roman
        typeface to give it the classic newspaper look and a drop shadow to add some visual depth.
        <br>
        <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Prototype.png" alt="prototype of figma file" width="50%">
        <figcaption>Original Vision of what it would look like</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br>
      <br>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/v1.png" alt="black and white box with times new roman text" width="100%">
        <figcaption>The standard box that I evolved the rest around</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        For the JavaScript part I decided to create scope variables specifically for the batchsize which would gradually
        increase how much news populates the page as the user scrolls more. I also used an array for the range of
        sentiment so that the content would get progressively more negative. I used WorldNewsCatcher.com for the api and
        they had a rating system for the content of their news with 0.9 being happy to -0.9 being horrible. I was also
        able to filter out languages and countries from the documentation guide that the api provided. I have it set to
        the US, UK, Canada, and France for now. I also created a function to make the boxes a variation of sizes. I also
        utilized a scroll function to ensure that the website knows when to reload a new batch of news once the user
        reaches the bottom of the window.
      </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        There were two issues I ran into as well which is that I have a daily amount of data requests from the free api
        website. To continue testing my site I created a for loop with fake content to ensure the scroll interaction was
        working. The other issue is that the content of the article also tends to repeat itself.
