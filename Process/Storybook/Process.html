                <h2>Original Idea/Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    For my storybook, I wanted to do a fun choose your own adventure-like concept. I was inspired by the
                    idea of making art come alive. I decided to go with the night at the museum idea to tell a a similar
                    story like one of my favorite childhood movies. The goal was to gameify the story and make it super
                    interactive for the user to enjoy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I brainstormed of simple, yet iconic paintings I could recreate with organic shapes. I landed on
                    Keith Haring because I thought his linework would be easier to code but also really enjoy his
                    colorful and lively style. I wanted to to have a feel like a children’s book and was thinking a lot
                    of the kid’s book “Goodnight Moon” when choosing colors and overall look.

                    The layout proces helped me plan a lot of what was feasible in coding. It allowed me to really think
                    out what will be the most plausible when it comes to the coding. I originally wanted to do a
                    different Keith Haring painting but went with the dog painting because I discovered it would be a
                    lot easier to code. I also figured that making a 1 point perspective room would be the best way to
                    convey dimension to a 2d space.

                    I would say the hardest parts were formatting the museum building and learning fixed, absolute, and
                    relative. I had to completely redo the positioning a few times.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also found this TikTok and thought it would add a dynamic element to the day and night page of the
                    storybook so I applied it to be a moon and sun’s color and glow.

                    The middle part of the story was also a challenge to code when figuring out the size of the
                    trapezoids. I struggles a lot with making it so their sizing would be responsive to the expansion of
                    the window. Eventually I played around with the vh and vw and before and after feature in css. I was
                    also going to have the paintings from the grid exercises skewed on the wall but realized that would
                    be too complex and did not want to take away emphasis from the main panting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the final part of the story i animated the noise drawings to shake a little as if the dogs were
                    barking. I also added audio to make the dogs come to life even more.
