        <h2>R1: A Handmade Web</h2>
        <h3>1. What is the thesis of this article?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          I believe that the thesis of this article is to emphasize the significance of having personally coded webpages
          as a form of creative expression. This is compared to the idea that modern society has seemed to forgotten the
          amount of unique work and creativity that goes into coding a webpage from scratch. The author relates the idea
          of “handmade” web pages being as much an artistic craft as developing a photo in a dark room. How the amount
          of comprehensive knowledge and skill that goes into that medium is a work of art in itself. Even the
          advancement of mobile phones has lessened the amount of work that goes into web design by not allowing the
          user to appreciate the complex code that built the site. Overall, I think the author is trying to convey the
          idea that with modern technology and site builders, web design is being overlooked and losing its novelty and
          the creative passion that is needed.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          To build upon my last answer, I think that the handmade web is a form of resistance to the lazier and
          uninventive alternative which is pre-coded website-building sites such as Squarespace or Wix. While these are
          easy options there is a loss of originality in exchange for a corporate-like design that everyone else has. I
          like to see “handmade” webs as being a virtual form of expression of sticking to the man or in this case
          retaliating against commercialization. Besides being a form of self-expression in the digital realm,
          hand-coded web pages can form a sense of DIY community for any sort of niche. Whether this be a fandom, tech
          fanatics, or just people who love to blog, handmade webpages bring together people who appreciate the amount
          of creative DIY work that goes into putting a webpage together for a community or cause they are excited
          about. With the commercialization of webpages, you lose the sense of passion that goes into curating unique
          experiences for these communities.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention to the "physicality" of
          the web?
        </h3>
        <p>I was born after the era of people hand-coding personal web pages to be a representation of themselves, so I
          never really got an appreciation for the amount of work that goes into designing a webpage until this class.
          However, I do remember people learning html and code to modify tumblr pages to further their self expression
          for themself or the fanbase they serve. Another example of the physicality of the web that I have experienced
          is something as simple as QR codes. They have become a widespread resource for providing information, linking
          apps or websites, etc. all by scanning a tangible image in the real world and then having it link to the
          digital realm. I have especially seen these since COVID-19 at restaurants. It makes it a touch free and easily
          accessible experience for anyone to view everything the restaurant has to offer. I have also seen Spotify’s
          version of QR codes where the physical sound waves of the sound have become simplified. That way it's easier
          for people to find that song or playlist.

          <h2>R2: What Screens Want</h2>
          <h3>1. What is the thesis of this article?</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            I think the thesis of this article is the idea that screens are an abstract metaphor. The way that we
            interact with screens can vary from person to person either through the flat or skeuo perspective.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>2. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo?</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            My beliefs align more with skeuo in the sense that I feel that a good portion of the population is not very
            imaginative. People like things to be very direct and to do so you have to imitate the real thing. However,
            I can also see the argument that people appreciate simplicity when it comes to function. Overly decorative
            logos and designs can often take away from the function itself and make the brand look too “flashy”. I
            personally enjoy the more skeuomorphic take on design because I think it adds another layer of complexity to
            try and mimic something from the real world. Mimicking the real world object into design feels like an art
            form or craftsmanship in itself. But maybe it’s also because I prefer maximalism over minimalism. I can
            understand why minimalists prefer the simplicity of flat design too.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>3. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from
            filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            A zoopraxiscope was made by Eadweard Muybridge and is a glass disc with images that were taken with a high
            speed camera of the time. These cameras could take consecutive photos within seconds. Then they are added to
            this glass disc and projected from behind while it simultaneously spins, creating a gif like effect.
            Muybridge’s creation relates to the web and interaction design by introducing society to the familiar glow
            of display screens. I think a possible example of a medium that has inspired digital design is maybe VR. I
            say this because it reminds me skeuo and how people must design VR with imitation in mind to make a 3d
            element within the display. Now skeuomorphism can be designed in the context of making it real world size
            too. VR is even designed to sometimes imitate how we function with that element as well. For example, if you
            switch a light in VR it may even look just like a light switch but you may even have to imitate the up and
            down hand movement to trigger it.

        <h2>R3: Interface and Interpolations</h2>
        <h3>1. How does Drucker define the term "interface"? How about the process of designing interfaces? What is her
          opinion of interface design processes as they are generally handled today?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Drucker defines the term “interface” as a space between human users and procedures that occur based on
          protocols or signals given to the computer. She also defines the structure of the interface as information.
          However, she dives much deeper into that saying that the structure of interface is just a space of action
          where it is told to do based on the signals.
          She describes the process of designing interfaces as psychoanalytical and has a deep-rooted humanistic
          approach. Drucker believes that the computational system is a symbolic space of our actions and behaviors in a
          digital form. She calls it the provocation to cognitive experience because of the way we interact with it and
          how the interface interacts with us in our daily lives.
        </p>
        <h3>2. What is Drucker's notion of "Humanistic Design"?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          It seems that Drucker’s notion of Humanistic Design is that it can vary based on the user. Rather than going
          on research or empirical evidence (which they have quoted) it leans towards an approach that is a little bit
          more subjective. By this I mean it’s based on the humanistic approach in regard to basing interface design on
          human behavior, yet it feels like Drucker’s notion is more of a personalized approach based on different
          behaviors. Everything is based on perception especially when it comes to the user experience. To summarize
          Drucker’s notion in my own words, she believes that since our experience of the world around us is so
          versatile, it manifests in infinite interface responses that support different, yet common behaviors. Our
          perceptions mold our behaviors and are not an accurate representation of the real world. She eventually goes
          on to relate this to the idea of “real time” that we project onto computer interfaces in relation to their
          refresh timing. She also says that this time is not real and the units of time are merely a metric we have
          created through our own perception since humans aren’t capable of perceiving the delay.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>3. As a process, what factors do you feel are central to the design of interfaces that are missing from this
          article?</h3>
        <p>
          I believe that a central aspect of designing interfaces is the concept of accessibility. It is crucial as
          designers to empathize with someone who may struggle with certain daily tasks and how we can make interfaces
          easy for them to use. It is often overlooked since many of these disabilities can be ones that aren’t even
          visible. A common example of the design process that supports accessibility is color and contrast. You often
          want a 4.5:1 color contrast ratio for normal text. This will greatly help people who are color blind or have
          vision impairments.
          <br>
          Another great example of accessible user interface design is utilizing screen reader software with your
          interface. This specifically helps people who are visually impaired or blind and use assistive devices.
          However, when using a screen reader you must also take into account the content too. That means organizing and
          prioritizing content, creating accurate alt text, and avoiding hidden navigation elements.

        <h2>R4: Database as Symbolic Form</h2>
        <h3>1. How does Manovich see the opposition between database and narrative? Manovich talks about computer games
          as a form of Interactive Narrative. Can you speculate on other forms of interactive narratives (in our culture
          or imagined) that aren't computer games?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Manovich sees the opposition between database and narrative as different ways of presenting information to the
          user. The biggest difference is that the database is delivered in a non-linear structure. Meanwhile, narrative
          is presented in a linear structure that is crucial to the user experience and the story telling aspect that
          plays into the narrative. He also states that databases correspond to the data structure, in comparison to
          algorithms strictly following an algorithm. An analog version that makes me think of this is those choose your
          own adventure story books. They remind me of this because they are similar to a game but are a non traditional
          way of storytelling. They had many different paths you could take with the user in full control of their
          journey throughout the experience. A digital version of that could be like interactive Netflix shows like the
          Black Mirror: Bander Snatch episode.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Database as Symbolic Form was written 19 years ago now. What has changed? What hasn't changed? Did
          Manovich's predictions come true?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          The biggest change since this article was written was the technological advancements of databases. Now
          databases have much more processing power and may not even be tangible objects like CDs but rather a cloud
          storage. User Interaction has drastically changed with social media. This enables users to contribute to the
          creation of distribution of this digital data as well. However, linear narratives are still a concept that
          remains a staple in our culture. Interactive and non-linear storytelling has gained popularity, movies and
          books are still a part of our mainstream culture. Manovich’s prediction of the dominance of the database
          became more accurate than ever now. Everything we own is stored on the cloud with major companies controlling
          this data with their clouds. His prediction of “algorithmic culture” became true through things like social
          media, streaming, and dating apps. Our everyday activities can be evolved around this algorithmic culture and
          how we virtually interact with others.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>3. Can you draw a connection between Manovich's ideas and your plan for your final project?</h3>
        <p>
          Relating to Manovich’s idea of semiotics and databases, I also want to use visual symbols to represent the web
          pages that I created. For my index, I hope to use everyday objects and personal knick knacks to represent not
          only my work, but me as an overall designer and person. Similarly, I want to encapsulate his notion that the
          connections between data points contribute to the overall semiotic structure of the database. The goal of
          curating these items is to create an overall aesthetic. I want it to look like a purse spilled and all its
          items tell a story about the owner. I also want the user interaction to be creative and incorporate a
          narrative into it. I am a big fan of storytelling so I think this could be a great opportunity to have the
          user interact with my site in an engaging way that also makes them have to think a little bit about what each
          item symbolizes.

        <h2>R5: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge</h2>
        <h3>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her?
          Please explain your answer.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media because it allows the user behind the screen to
          have more agency. With a hand-coded website the user can have full control of the content and how that
          information is presented to the world. Compared to social media, websites allow the user to have full creative
          control of how they want to express themselves. Social media platforms typically do not have the user in mind
          other than to shove advertisements in your face. I agree with her because I like that she describes a website
          as being an infinite amount of possibilities and interpretations. I like having my own personal website so I
          can express myself through intentional interactions that others have with my site. For example, my index will
          be a plethora of scanned items from my home. These items are symbolic of the creative projects I coded in
          class and I put a lot of thought into how the user may have to step into my brain in order to correlate the
          objects with the corresponding project. The user experience that plays into the interaction of my site can
          share a lot more about my creative thought process, than an Instagram post could ever show. When I am able to
          be the author and architect of how I want to virtually personify myself I can design endless variations of how
          I want the user to perceive me, rather than be restricted to the same cookie-cutter interface that everybody
          uses.
        </p>
        <h3>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a
          paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to
          extend that comparison. Upload it to your Github server and post the link here.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Just like a website an artist’s canvas is endless possibilities of ways to express themself. Each brush stroke
          is an intentional organization of information with the idea of visual hierarchy and flow as a priority. Every
          different color is the unique content that makes up the website. A conglomeration of vibrant colors
          illustrates the tone that the content is trying to convey. The thoughtful control of the brush’s linewidth is
          the amount of content that the creator wants to show the viewer. Just like a canvas, the webpage is as
          limitless as the imagination. Overall, these features paint a collective representation of how the creator
          wants to share and structure their vision.
