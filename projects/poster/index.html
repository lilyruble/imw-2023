                <p>No twenty movies can truly evoke the mass delusion called “1968.” (“What’s happening?” was the
                    question
                    of the day.) But these films, each in its own way, is an attempted report from the front—not just
                    Paris,
                    Prague and the U.S., but Italy, Japan, and Vietnam. Taken as a binge they provide a taste of the
                    era’s
                    strange brew, a heady sci-fi concoction of TV violence, Third World warfare, generational
                    megalomania,
                    druggy disengagement, imaginary liberated zones, whiplash changes, and the fearfully hoped-for
                    collapse
                    of social norms. Or, put another way, each of these movies secretly believes that life is a movie,
                    and
                    seeks to represent chaos through the surprisingly widespread reinvention of film form.

                        <br> Power to the People: Made in Algeria and banned for years in France,
                        Italian filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo’s quasi-documentary re-creation of a Third World
                        revolutionary struggle was arguably the late ‘60s’s most incendiary feature—dividing
                        audiences
                        at the 1967 New York Film Festival, alarming the police, and providing inspiration for
                        African
                        American militants. During the trial of the Panther 21, the prosecution introduced the movie
                        as
                        evidence. After the trial, one juror remarked that The Battle of Algiers “did more to help
                        me
                        see things from the defense point of view than the D.A. suspected.” Agnès Varda’s short
                        documentary Black Panthers is a casually electrifying account of Black Panther Party rallies
                        and
                        demonstrations. Made in Oakland during the summer of 1968, it was commissioned by French TV,
                        which then refused to show it.
